(What is this project? What does it do? Who is it for?)

## Conventions
(Code style, naming patterns, libraries used, tool preferences.)

## Decisions
(Choices that have been made and the reasoning behind them.)

## Gotchas
(Things to remember about this codebase that might trip up future
sessions — quirks, non-obvious dependencies, common mistakes.)

## Active tasks
(What's currently being worked on. Clear entries when work completes.)
